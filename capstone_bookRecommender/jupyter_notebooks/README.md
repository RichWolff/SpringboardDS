# Springboard Data Science Career Track - Capstone 2
### Creating a Collaborative Filter

##### Capstone Jupyter Notebooks
	•	intial_data_exploration: The original exploration before deciding if I wanted to use this data set. I looked at the difficulty of loading the data and some of the initial issues I may have run into (what does a rating of 0 mean? Can we match authors of the books?)
	•	capstone2_exploratory_graph_analysis: This was the first look into the statistics of the data. I also explored what using a graph data structure was like. Visualized what the connections in the network looked like and found out that most users don't read/rate much but most ratings come from a few users.
	•	capstone2_recommender_model: This is where I built the user collaborative filter combined with the logistic regression model.
	•	capstone2_item_filter: Unfinished start to building an item filter for the model.
